# Routing-Number-Verifier

This project was made using Python and Selenium to familiarize myself with fintech and to resolve a common problem of users mistyping their routing number when trying to access bank information. By using the federal reserve website, I coded a script that checks if the user-inputted routing number is valid and if so, returns the bank name, city, and state.
